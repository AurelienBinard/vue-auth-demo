# Vue Auth Demo with Firebase

> A Vue.js project that provides a simple demo for securing pages with vue-router, Vuex and Firebase to handle authentication and user management.

**Please note you will need to add your own firebase credentials to the [config](https://github.com/garethredfern/vue-auth-demo/blob/master/src/main.js#L10).**
